I upload practice problems on this repository.

Problems are from different sources such as leetcode, hackerrank, geeksforgeeks.

I will be uploading every week. For now, I am solving basic problems. As I progress, I will be uploading problems with increased difficulty.

Also, through the process of uploading my solutions on GitHub, I learn more about version control and git :)
